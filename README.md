# Storyline Visualization for League of Legends

## Introduction

Players increasingly adopt a data-driven approach to review and improve their gaming skills. In the wake of this, spatio-temporal visualizations gained popularity but remain challenging to design. Storyline visualizations are unique in the way they integrate time and location information into a single view to show how entity relationships develop over time. We adopt the storyline visualization technique to summarize gameplay for the purpose of post-play review.
For more details, check [our paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3611058).
As for now, this web app supports visualizing the following information:
- Basic player information (which champion is used for which team)
- Players' positions in 1 minute intervals
- Players' kills and deaths
- Tower kills
- Areas on a map reflected on y-axis (e.g. jungle)

This app would also allow user to get detailed information of each event by hovering over the event/storylines.
An example of storyline visualization for a League of Legends match is shown below:

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/add/) to install iStoryline.

```Shell
npm install i-storyline-js
```

or

```Shell
yarn add i-storyline-js
```

## Basic Usage of iStoryline framework

```JavaScript
import iStoryline from "i-storyline-js"
let iStoryliner = new iStoryline();

// generate storyline visualizations from the story script
let storyScriptUrl = './data/xml/Redcap.xml';

// graph can be drawed using any canvas or svg libraries
let graph = iStoryliner.load(storyScriptUrl);

// obtain the characters names
console.log(graph.characters);  // ['Red cap', 'Mother', 'Wolf', 'GrandMa']

// obtain the paths of the characters
console.log(graph.storylines);  // [[[x1, y1], [x2, y2], ...], ...]
```

## Basic Usage of iStoryline framework for League of Legends

First using our python project to fetch the match data and convert it into a storyline json file. This will ultimately gives you match spatio-temporal data, general match information file, a killing info file and a DBSCAN result.
For this, check our [Lol_Storyline Data](https://github.com/tiange997/LoL-Storyline-Data) project and follow the instructions there.

You should put your visualization instance javascript file under the `/app/js` folder. You should also check the `/data/json/Match` 
folder to see the data files that are used in the storyline visualisation.

To create a new match visualization instance, you can start copying one file from the `/app/js` folder, rename it and make changes as following:

```JavaScript

// adding match info to the storyline (fetched from Riot API)
const jsonRead = d3Fetch.json('../../data/json/xxx.json')

// adding killing info file generated by python
const jsonReadTwo = d3Fetch.json('../../data/json/xxx.json') 

// adding DBSCAN result file generated by python
const jsonDBSCAN = d3Fetch.json('../../data/json/xxx.json')

// adding the match data generated by python for parsing
main('xxx.json');


```
Please then check and modify the webpack config file for new entry.

### Notes

- Drawing APIs are based on [canvas](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp) or [svg](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_svg.asp).

## Storyline Board

iStoryline.js provides a build-in editor for producing storyline visualizations.

1. Install Node.js (>= 10.0)

2. Install dependencies `npm i` or `yarn`

3. Start the editor `npm run start`

4. Please visit [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

Storyline visualizations are unique in the way they integrate time and location information into a single view to show how entity relationships develop over time. We adopt the storyline visualization technique to summarize gameplay for the purpose of post-play review. We demonstrate the method by applying it to League of Legends matches and evaluated it with 39 players of the game in a task-based online study using the triad framework for spatio-temporal queries by Peuquet. Results indicate that players responded positively to the approach and could, by and large, solve tasks well but that time-based tasks proved most challenging and least efficient to solve. Based on our findings, we reflect on possibilities for enhancing the design of storyline visualizations for game-related data analysis.},
